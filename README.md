## <ins>Background<ins/>

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, I organized and analyzed a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.

## <ins>Deep dive into Crowdfunding!<ins/>

This report will look at the crowdfunding campaigns.
-	Comparison with GB and US crowdfunding campaigns
- Successful sub-categories
 - Relationships between the success rate and month of launch
Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

Successful campaigns in the US

Successful campaigns in the UK

Looking at the above data, crowdfunding is a popular form of investment in the US, in comparison to GB. Out of 1000 campaigns, 763 campaigns were in the US compared to 48 campaigns in the GB. 436 campaigns have been successful in the US, which is nearly half the total campaigns. 

Overall Successful categories

There is a higher success rate for campaigns in the ‘plays’ sub-category (187). As a collective the other sub-categories have an average of 16 with a median of 13, which is far below the figure given by ‘plays’. 


Month of successful campaigns

From the statistics above, you can see that the success and failure of a campaign is not dependent on the month in which the campaign was launched. However,   it must be taken into account that this may not be the case for all campaigns in the future, as some may depend on seasonality.

<ins>The limitations of this dataset<ins/>
- At which point did the respective campaign succeed or fail
- Reasons for failed campaigns 

<ins>Other tables/graphs that could add value<ins/>
- The simplicity of a pie charts enables the end user of the report to easily identify, understand, and compare multiple categories within the dataset, as it collaborates the data into ta circular format. 

- Standard deviation graph can also be beneficial as they can show how the data set is distributed and how much it deviates from the mean. Mean can sometimes be unreliable as the figures within the data can be clustered away from one another. 


<ins>Bonus Statistical analysis<ins/>

*Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarises the data more meaningfully.*

I believe the median may best represent the data due to the distribution of the data set and there being clear outliers. Looking at the standard deviation, it shows the data is very much dispersed, so the mean may not summarise the data meaningfully.

*Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?*

When using the standard deviation, you can see that the gap between the mean and the standard deviation values are similar for both successful and unsuccessful. Thus, the variability between both, is relatively equal. 

If we only use the variance figures, then it appears that there is a far greater variability between successful and unsuccessful campaigns. With successful having far greater variability. Hence the variability would not make sense.
